Title: Integrierte Kampagne für Hella Gutmann I B2B-Cases

Hella Gutmann, a leading provider of diagnostic and repair solutions in the automotive sector, faced the challenge of introducing its flagship product, the mega macs X, to the market. The mission: to provide independent workshops with a future-proof solution for multi-brand diagnostics through a compelling and memorable campaign that positioned the mega macs X as the ultimate flexible workshop solution.
The integrated campaign aimed to present the product with a completely fresh approach and deliver a clear message: the mega macs X represents maximum flexibility in vehicle diagnostics. This was visually reinforced with a distinctive black-and-green colour scheme and high-quality, dynamic product photography. These elements became the cornerstone of the communication strategy, positioning the product as a state-of-the-art solution that combines modern design with unparalleled adaptability.
The campaign placed workshop professionals' needs and challenges at its heart. With its flexible licensing model and versatile applications, the mega macs X offers workshops a modern approach to multi-brand diagnostics. The messaging underscored how the mega macs X simplifies daily tasks by providing tailored diagnostic solutions for various vehicle types, all while guaranteeing maximum flexibility.
“Never before have trade show attendants known so much about a product and its benefits. Everyone already knew about the mega macs X. That’s why the sales talks at the fairs were considerably easier.”
