Title: Corporate Website Relaunch für Berrang| B2B-Cases

New Website, New Experience: Berrang Reveals What Holds the World Together.
Berrang,a leading provider of fasteners, has often been perceived by the general public as merely a "bolt supplier." However, its newly relaunched website proves there is much more to Berrang. The revamped digital space showcases the company’s expertise and passion for precision, offering visitors an engaging, interactive journey through the universe of connection technology.
The challenge was to position Berrang not just as a supplier of fasteners but as a pioneer and expert in connection technology. The central idea was to make the “Berrang experience” tangible from the moment visitors land on the site. The fascination with technology and meticulous attention to detail had to be immediately evident, reflecting the premium quality of the products and the company’s technical expertise.
Berrang’s employees share a passion for precision and technological excellence, and this is reflected in every aspect of the new website. Visitors experience what it means to work with Berrang—from technological expertise to the precision embodied in every product. The site captures this ethos, presenting Berrang as a partner that masters the "small" things that hold the world together.
By combining scrollytelling with 3D elements, the new website transcends the role of a simple information platform. Visitors feel the technological ambition and innovative spirit of Berrang, witnessing the transformation of a perceived “bolt supplier” into a trailblazer in connection technology.
Experience it firsthand and immerse yourself in the Berrang universe!
