Title: DXP für ebm-papst Events | B2B-Cases

A Virtual Showroom for Seamless Customer Experiences.
ebm-papst, the global leader in fan and motor innovation, sought to elevate its interaction with customers to new heights. To showcase its innovative and sustainable solutions in a captivating and individualised way, the ebm-papst Digital Experience Platform (DXP) was created—a virtual showroom that not only brings products to life but also delivers a personalised, interactive customer journey.
The DXP is more than just a platform; it’s a personalised meeting point for customers and prospects. Visitors can explore interactive virtual spaces filled with product information, presented through clickable elements for an immersive experience. 
The platform offers what could be described as a "dating experience" for engineers and decision-makers in the industry: from over 20,000 products and solutions, users are presented with tailored content based on their individual interests. This transforms each visit into a unique journey through the world of ebm-papst.
Using a data-driven approach, the DXP learns about each user over time, dynamically delivering fresh, relevant content. For instance, the highlight showroom features new developments tailored to the latest industry challenges, all while focusing on energy efficiency. This positions ebm-papst as a leader in innovative and sustainable technologies.
